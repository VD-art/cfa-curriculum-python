#  CFA Curriculum in Python

A personal project to **learn and practice the entire CFA curriculum** by building:
- Python calculators
- Models
- Visualizations
- Well-documented notebooks

This helps me (and anyone) deeply understand each CFA topic **by coding, not just memorizing**.

##  What’s inside

##  Current topics

| Module                | Topics |
|----------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Quantitative Methods  | IRR, NPV, mean, variance, standard deviation, covariance, correlation, time value of money |
| Economics             | GDP growth models, inflation calculators, currency conversion |
| FSA                   | Financial ratios, common size statements |
| Equity                | DDM model, P/E ratio analysis |
| Fixed Income          | Yield to Maturity, bond pricing, duration |
| Portfolio             | Beta, portfolio variance, CAPM |

*(More modules and calculators will be added step by step)*

##  How to use

1. Clone or download this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VD-art/cfa-curriculum-python.git
```

2. Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open notebooks (in notebooks/) to see formulas, Python code, and explanations.
4. Use functions from scripts/ in your own projects.

## Why I’m doing this

“If you can’t explain it to a computer, you probably don’t understand it yourself.”

By building Python code for every CFA topic:

• I force myself to truly understand the formulas
• I create a real, reusable toolkit for investing & finance
• And I learn modern, practical Python & Git skills

This is a living project — notebooks and functions will grow as I progress through the CFA curriculum.
