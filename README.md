#  CFA Curriculum in Python

A personal project to **learn and practice the entire CFA curriculum** by building:
- Python calculators
- Models
- Visualizations
- Well-documented notebooks

This helps me (and anyone) deeply understand each CFA topic **by coding, not just memorizing**.

## Modules

| Module | Scripts | Notebooks |
|----------------------:|-------:|----------:|
| Quantitative Methods | [scripts/quant/README.md](scripts/quant/README.md) | [notebooks/quant/README.md](notebooks/quant/README.md) |


> Each module folder has its own README with details, formulas, and files.

> More modules and calculators will be added step by step

##  How to use

1. Clone or download this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VD-art/cfa-curriculum-python.git
```

2. Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open notebooks (in notebooks/) to see formulas, Python code, and explanations.
4. Use functions from scripts/ in your own projects.

## Why I’m doing this

“If you can’t explain it to a computer, you probably don’t understand it yourself.”

By building Python code for every CFA topic:

• I force myself to truly understand the formulas

• I create a real, reusable toolkit for investing & finance

• And I learn modern, practical Python & Git skills

> This is a living project — notebooks and functions will grow as I progress through the CFA curriculum.
